# Welcome to my GitHub Page. 
I am a UX Researcher and Designer currently working for the Canadian federal government at Environment and Climate Change Canada, turning complex regulatory workflows into intuitive web applications.

My skill set includes designing complex interactive and accessible web applications, conducting and analyzing qualitative UX research, and developing full-stack web applications.

I am also the creator of QualSearch (www.qualsearch.io), an AI-enabled qualitative research data repository and analysis tool for research teams that deal with customer data. QualSearch is currently in beta testing; please connect with me if youâ€™re interested in early access.
